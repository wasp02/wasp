        "The scale and intensity of the action George Miller brings to the screen came as a pleasant surprise. Perhaps this is, in part, to my ignorance of previous Mad Max films or any other George Miller flick, apart, of course, from Happy Feet.",
        "Coming into this film blind to George Miller's antics was somewhat of a blessing, to begin with. Fury Road takes on one of the more unique filmmaking styles that leverages chaos as a centrepiece. The first act had me hooked, and how can you not be as George Miller takes no time to get the show on the road. The only component holding it back from the beginning is the uninspiring villain Immortan Joe who gives a flat depiction of an authoritarian leader who almost seems like the sort of villain you see at a pantomime. An odd casting choice, perhaps one clouded by nostalgia.",
        "The carnage that ensues, paired with fantastic cinematography, allows you to get sucked into George Miller's dystopian post-apocalyptic world from the get-go. The colour palates, costumes and set design are stellar and together bring together a visual spectacle. It’s no wonder it won Oscars for all three categories. Although I will say, the sped-up scenes don’t work at all apart from making you second guess whether your Blu-ray is taking a turn for the worse.",
        "The dynamic between Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron makes for some great exchanges during the slower-paced scenes - which come as a nice change of pace. As impressive as the action scenes are in this film, the novelty of explosions and maniac guitar players soon starts to become less thrilling during the last act, and this is my issue with Mad Max: Fury Road. It lacks depth. George Miller's tunnel vision on this one avenue of storytelling seems to lose its magic for me during the last act. Of course, this is the style of the film, but it feels like the detonator was pressed too many times.",
        "I guess that’s why the film had such a contrasting response from viewers, more positive than negative, and that’s understandable. In the areas it does well at, it excels. If you have a thirst for non-stop action, then it doesn’t get much better than Fury Road. However, if you want a story to unfold that will leave you thinking, then you’ll be disappointed. And yes, you can have both.",
        "Going down this one-way road of pure, unadulterated explosions fails to provide any depth to the film. Sure, you have the mystery of the Green Place, but once that narrative is dead, where does George Miller decide to take the story? Well, just hit rewind because you're essentially watching the first half in reverse without the mystery of future plotlines. The only plot line left once they hit a U-turn is the potential developments to Nuxs character, but once he sacrifices himself, the story writes itself, and it’s not a great one.",
        "See, but I get it, everyone who loves this film loves it because it focuses on what the film does well, overzealous action, but it feels like you really have to have some sort of attachment to raw on-screen action to enjoy this film from start to finish. It’s a shame because the performances of the main characters are great - when they have the opportunity to do so.",
        "It's evident that George Miller had a clear vision for this film and didn’t care for manufacturing a dynamic story just for the sake of it. He knew that the quality of the action would carry the film, and for most people, this works. Unfortunately for me, it only works for two-thirds of the film, and that’s enough for me to give this film a 6.8 / 10. There aren’t many flaws in Mad Max: Fury Road, but unfortunately, one of those flaws is storytelling.",

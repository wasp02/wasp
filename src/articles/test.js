        "It came as a pleasant surprise, the scale and intensity of the action scenes George Miller brings to the screen. Perhaps this is, in part, to my ignorance of previous Mad Max films or any other George Miller flick.",
        "Coming into this film blind to George Miller's antics was somewhat of a blessing, to begin with. Fury Road takes on one of the more unique styles of filmmaking that leverages chaos as a centrepiece for the film. The first act had me hooked and aside from the terrible villain Immortan Joe - what kind of name is Joe for a villain btw and prefixing it with Immortan makes him sound like a male stripper – it provides an open-ended narrative which gets you hooked. Along with the carnage that ensues and great cinematography, allows you to get sucked into George Miller's dystopian post-apocalyptic world from the get-go. The colour palate, costumes and set design are stellar and it’s no wonder it won Oscars for all three categories. Although I will say the sped-up scenes don’t work at all, apart from making you second guess whether your Blu-ray is taking a turn for the worse.",
        "The dynamic between Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron makes for some great exchanges during the slower-paced scenes - which come as a nice change of pace. As impressive as the action scenes are in this film and impressive, they are (little to no shaky cam, that’s a thumbs up from me) the novelty of explosions and maniac guitar players soon started to become less interesting during the last act of the film. And this is my issue with Mad Max: Fury Road, it lacks depth, George Miller's tunnel vision on this one avenue of expressing a story seemed to lose its magic for me during the later stages of the film. Of course, this is the style of the film, but it feels like the button was pressed too many times.",
        "I guess that’s why the film had such a contrasting response from viewers, more positive than negative and that’s understandable. If you have a thirst for non-stop action then it doesn’t get much better than this, however, if you want a story to unfold that will leave you thinking then you’ll be disappointed. And yes, you can have both.",
        "Going down this one-way road just fails to provide any depth to the film, sure the first act and a half are a great spectacle, and you even have the mystery of the Green Place but once that narrative is dead, where does George Miller decide to take the story? Well just hit rewind because you're essentially watching the first half in reverse. I probably would have enjoyed the film more if I just rewatched the first half. The only interesting plot line left once they hit a U-turn was the potential developments to Nuxs character, but once he sacrifices himself the story writes itself.",
        "See but I get it, everyone who loves this film loves it because it focuses on what the film does well, overzealous action, but there’s no depth to the storytelling and that’s what makes it so hard to keep me interested, and we’re talking about a relatively short run time. It’s a shame because the performances of the main characters are great - when they have the opportunity to do so.",
        "It's evident that George Miller had a clear vision for this film and didn’t care for manufacturing a dynamic story just for the sake of it, and knew that the quality of the action would carry the film. And for most people, this works, unfortunately for me, it only works for two-thirds of the film and that’s just enough for me to give this film a 7.5 / 10. That may seem surprising after reading two paragraphs of slander. There are only a few aspects to criticize but unfortunately, one of those aspects is storytelling.",
